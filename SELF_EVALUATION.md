## 🧠 SELF_EVALUATION.md

### 📝 **Summary**
During this project, I successfully built a **React-based Task Management Application** that organizes tasks into “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done” categories.  
What went well was the **component-based architecture**, which made the project organized and scalable. The integration of **Bootstrap** provided a responsive, visually clean layout. API integration with **Axios** worked smoothly for CRUD operations.  

Challenges included managing **state updates** efficiently between components, especially when updating task statuses, and ensuring that UI rendering remained consistent with API data. I also found debugging asynchronous calls slightly time-consuming.  

Overall, the project helped me strengthen my understanding of **React fundamentals**, **props drilling**, and **API handling** in a real-world setup.

### ⚙️ **Self-Criticism**
Although functional, my code could be more optimized. Some components (like `NotesApp`) handle multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further **separation of logic** (e.g., using custom hooks).  
Error handling for API failures is minimal, and there’s no proper **loading state or validation** when adding tasks.  
CSS customization is mostly dependent on Bootstrap; a mix of custom styling or styled-components could improve uniqueness and maintainability.

### 🚀 **Improvements (If Given More Time)**
- Implement **custom hooks** for API handling and state management.  
- Add **form validation** and **error handling** for better UX.  
- Introduce a **backend database** (Node.js + MongoDB) for persistence.  
- Add **drag-and-drop functionality** for easier task movement between columns.  
- Improve **UI consistency** with more modern styling techniques (e.g., TailwindCSS or Styled Components).  
- Add **search and filter** features for better task management.

| Technology        | Self-Rating (/10) | Remarks |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| **React.js**      | 8/10 | Strong grasp of components, props, and state, but can improve optimization. |
| **API Integration (Axios)** | 7/10 | Successfully implemented CRUD, but error handling can be better. |
| **CSS / Bootstrap** | 8/10 | Responsive design achieved, though limited custom styling used. |
| **JavaScript (Logic & Structure)** | 8/10 | Clean structure but can improve modularity. |
| **Project Architecture** | 9/10 | Well-structured hierarchy and clear data flow. |
